Our project, Farm Navigator by Hydrosense BD, is designed to help farmers adapt to these challenges by turning NASA’s open Earth observation data into actionable guidance. Using datasets such as SMAP (soil moisture), MODIS/VIIRS (vegetation health), and GPM (precipitation), combined with GIS tools and ground-level sensors, we will provide farmers with localized insights on soil conditions, water availability, crop suitability, and flood risk.

🔹 Key Components of Our Solution

Farmer-Friendly Data Platform – A bilingual (English & Bangla) website/app that translates NASA’s data into simple recommendations (e.g., “Plant rice in this area next week” or “Delay irrigation due to expected rainfall”).

Agro Robot – A low-cost robot that tests soil nutrient levels, pH, and moisture, validating satellite predictions with on-the-ground data.

Floating Hydroponic Farms – IoT-enabled hydroponic farming systems that can float on floodwaters, ensuring continuous food production during disasters.

Smart Alerts & Forecasts – Early warning notifications for droughts, floods, and crop risks based on real-time NASA data.
